# HAPISCRIPT

## Description

This is a simple boilerplate for a rest api designed with hapi and typescript. This particular api example has 4 entities:
1. User
2. Role
3. User Profile
4. Notification

The primary motivation behind this project was to build an organized codebase for rest apis built with typescript that contains
all the necessary backend best practices. Even though hapi.js is a pretty good and most importantly a battle tested framework, capable
of handling heavy loads, I couldn't find a proper boilerplate that would start off my projects with ease. So, I decided to build one myself

If you're looking for a boilerplate containing the basic functionalities like payload compressors, file-processor, authentication, casbin
authorization and on top of them all, uses typescript, then this is the boilerplate for you.

Feel free to make pull requests if you wish to improve it further
